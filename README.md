# Letta Telegram Bot

Multi-user Telegram bot for Letta cloud. This bot lets you provide your agents and agent architectures to end-users. Heavily inspired by <https://github.com/letta-ai/letta-telegram/>

## Flexibility & Contributions Welcome

This project is a research tool for rapidly testing agent architectures with real users. We're very flexible - feel free to open an issue or PR for:

- Different storage backends support (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.)
- Alternative deployment strategies (k8s, serverless, edge, etc.)
- Custom authorization flows (OAuth, payments, invites, etc.)
- Anything else that could be useful for your case

**Have a different setup or need?** We're very open to supporting new patterns and configurations. Please:

- 🐛 **Open an issue** for bugs or unexpected behavior
- 💡 **Request features** or discuss new deployment scenarios
- 🔧 **Share your use case** if you need different storage/auth/deployment options
- 💬 **Ask questions** about adapting the bot to your needs
- 🤝 **Submit PRs** for improvements, fixes, or new flexibility options

We're committed to keeping this bot adaptable for different client deployments and technical requirements. Your feedback helps make it better for everyone!
