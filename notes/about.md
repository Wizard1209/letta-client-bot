**About This Bot**

This is a multi-user Telegram bot that provides access to AI assistants powered by Letta. Each user gets their own personal assistants with persistent memory and advanced capabilities.

**Available Assistant Templates**

**knowledge-base-demo (Claude Sonnet)**
Your personal librarian with deep self-awareness. I don't just store information—I actively organize, index, and curate it. I understand the *difference* between what belongs in core memory (your current context), archival storage (persistent knowledge), and conversation history. I verify before storing, maintain a memory index for retrieval, and have metacognition that lets me continuously improve how I serve you. Sonnet's advanced reasoning excels at understanding nuance, making complex organizational decisions, and adapting my structure to your needs.

**knowledge-base-demo-cheap (Claude Haiku)**
Your personal librarian optimized for efficiency. I maintain the same self-aware memory architecture—organizing information into core memory, searchable archives, and conversation history. I understand what to store where and maintain an index for retrieval. Haiku handles this organizational work quickly and cost-effectively, best for straightforward storage, retrieval, and interactions where speed matters over deep analytical reasoning.
