**About This Bot**

This is a multi-user Telegram bot that provides access to AI assistants powered by Letta. Each user gets their own personal assistants with persistent memory and advanced capabilities.

**Available Assistant Templates**

**Librarian (Claude Haiku)**
Your personal librarian optimized for efficiency. I maintain the same self-aware memory architecture—organizing information into core memory, searchable archives, and conversation history. I understand what to store where and maintain an index for retrieval. Haiku handles this organizational work quickly and cost-effectively, best for straightforward storage, retrieval, and interactions where speed matters over deep analytical reasoning.
